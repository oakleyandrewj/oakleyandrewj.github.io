### Case Management BlackBox API

I know a teacher who needs to record how students feel about their lesson before they leave the room. The idea is they will do this by pressing on an interactive whiteboard.

[Student Response Tool](https://github.com/oakleyandrewj/StudentResponseTool)

It's a simple web tool written in html/css/jscript that records each student results silently in memory and then summarises this when the teacher presses 'finish'


### Case Management BlackBox API

I've been working on an API that can be used as a template to speed up integration-type applications with Case Management Systems.

[CaseMan API](https://github.com/oakleyandrewj/CaseManAPI)

It's a .net 6 ASP.net core API that builds and runs self-contained. To get from this template to prod you need to hook it into your data layer/ORM tool, write some Unit Tests, replace the self-cert if you want https, and setup your prod config. A good jump-start


### Visualfiles Code Snippet Tool

Downtime in December 21 means I can work on some utils ive had ideas for for a while. The code editor on a proprietary platform I had been using was a long way from perfect so I made this...

[Snippet Manager Repo](https://github.com/oakleyandrewj/VisualfilesSnippetManager)

Its a self contained desktop form that uses an xml file to store code snippets rather than needing a db connection. Only platform specific because it swawps out & from a reserved character in the xml.
If anyone wants to pick it up an make it pretty or add functionality, fire away! Fully operational as-is. Details in repo readme :-)
