### Visualfiles Code Snippet Tool

Downtime in December 21 means I can work on some utils ive had ideas for for a while. The code editor on a proprietary platform I had been using was a long way from perfect so I made this...

[Snippet Manager Repo](https://github.com/oakleyandrewj/VisualfilesSnippetManager)

Its a self contained desktop form that uses an xml file to store code snippets rather than needing a db connection. Only platform specific because it swawps out & from a reserved character in the xml.
If anyone wants to pick it up an make it pretty or add functionality, fire away! Fully operational as-is. Details in repo readme :-)
